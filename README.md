## Current development process

2016-3-3
Our project has been launched! Thanks to all of us!

2016-3-5
First developers' meeting, decision of language, utilities, facilities and organization!

2016-3-6
Second developers’ meeting, finished requirement analysis, pushing the development into general design progress.

2016-3-7
Decision of using Python 2.7 has been changed to using Python 3.4. Keeping sharp & new is far better than staying outdated.

2016-3-10
The original design of transmitter module.

2016-3-20
Finished data designing, Including three means of transportation, 10 cities and hundreds of direct paths.

2016-3-21
Introducing mailer, the main machanism for module communication.
More in the code!
